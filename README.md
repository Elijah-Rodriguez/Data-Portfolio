# Data Analysis Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, I'm Elijah! This is a collection of personal Data Analytics and Machine Learning projects utilizing tools such as SQL, Python, Excel, and BI Tools such as Tableau. I'm a graduate from the University of Central Florida eager to apply my foundation of data analytics to help businesses make more confident and meaningful decisions as an entry-level Data Analyst.

During my time at UCF, I worked to gain strong experience with Python and MySQL, specifically for machine learning applications and simple querying. Post-graduation, I have been honing my skills in PostgreSQL, Tableau, and PowerBI while reinforcing my knowledge on fundamentals such as data cleaning and statistical analysis.
