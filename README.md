# Data Analysis Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, I'm Elijah! This is a collection of personal Data Analytics and Machine Learning projects utilizing tools such as SQL, Python, Excel, and BI Tools such as Tableau. I'm a graduate from the University of Central Florida eager to apply my foundation of data analytics to help businesses make more confident and meaningful decisions as an entry-level Data Analyst/Data Engineer.

During my time at UCF, I worked to gain strong experience with Python and MySQL, specifically for machine learning applications and simple querying. Post-graduation, I have been honing my skills in PostgreSQL, Tableau, and PowerBI while reinforcing my knowledge on fundamentals such as data cleaning and statistical analysis.

## Data Analysis Projects

### Fraud Detection
**Code:** [Here](https://github.com/Elijah-Rodriguez/data-analysis/tree/main/Fraud%20Detection)

**Goal:** Monitoring how a fraud detection model has been doing over time and figuring out why it's not working as it should using Python.

**Description:** London's Poundbank needs help to figure out why their fraud detection models aren't as accurate anymore. Poundbank recommends the nannyml library for monitoring machine learning models, which is also their tool of choice. Some objectives are asked to be followed, including noting periods of alerts, feature correlation, and plotting univariate drift detection distributions.

**Skills:** data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Tools:** Python.


### Plant Co. Performance Dashboard
**Code:** [Here](https://github.com/Elijah-Rodriguez/data-analysis/tree/main/Plant%20Co%20Performance%20Dashboard)

**Goal:** To get a dynamic overview of Plant Co. performance.

**Description:** This project is focused on creating a dynamic dashboard to analyze global performance for Plant Co. over the 2022-2024 period. Plant Co. has 3 seperate tables that range from fact tables to lookup tables as they would like insights over their entire operation. 

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Tools:** PostgreSQL, Microsoft PowerBI.


### Taste of the World Cafe Order Analysis
**Code:** [Here](https://github.com/Elijah-Rodriguez/data-analysis/tree/main/Taste%20of%20the%20World%20Analysis)

**Goal:** To analyze performance of a recent menu change.

**Description:** The fictional company Taste of the World Cafe has recently updated their menu. The cafe would like to get an overview of their quarterly performance and would like some insights on the performance of their new menu.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis.

**Tools:** PostgreSQL, Microsoft Excel.


## Machine Learning Projects

### MLOps Image Classification App
**Code:** [Here](https://github.com/Elijah-Rodriguez/image-classification-app)

**Goal:** Building and deploying a location image classifier using Tensorflow, Streamlit, Azure, and other tools.

**Description:** Created a pipeline based on a basic image classification CNN model on a python notebook. This pipeline copies a saved CNN model and an app framework built in Streamlit to a Docker image. This Docker image is then placed into an Azure Container Registry and hosted by an Azure Web App. All monitoring and deployment is handled through GitHub Actions.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, machine learning, CI/CD, data engineering.

**Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, Streamlit, Docker, Azure.


### NBA Match Predictor
**Code:** [Here](https://github.com/Elijah-Rodriguez/machine-learning/tree/main/NBA%20Match%20Predictor)

**Goal:** To see how accurate a model can predict the winner of an NBA game before the game starts.

**Description:** This project involves scraping data from the NBA API to compile a large dataset of all regular season performances. This dataset is used to train a model that can predict the outcome of a game before a matchup.

**Skills:** Webscraping, data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, machine learning, hyperparameter tuning.

**Tools:** NBA API, Python, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit.


### NBA Rookie of the Year Predictor
**Code:** [Here](https://github.com/Elijah-Rodriguez/machine-learning/tree/main/NBA%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Predictor)

**Goal:** To accurately predict which player will be voted for Rookie of the Year.

**Description:** My approach to this project was to see how accurate my model can predict the winner by focusing on tuning an XGB Regressor model that predicts voting share.

**Skills:** Webscraping, data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, machine learning, hyperparameter tuning.

**Tools:** Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Python, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, XGBoost.
